  ## About/Description

  This is a personal portfolio to showcase past projects for potential employers and other individuals.  This portfolio was built using React.js with React-Bootstrap and Bootstrap 5 to help assist with some of the styling and layout. Personal styling was done as well to give it a more unique look and help ensure it's adjustability between mobile and desktop screens.
